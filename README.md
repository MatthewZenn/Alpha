Alpha is a graphical interface and terminal app built on top of Sparky. At it's core, Alpha is built on two applications; a modified version of ```Sparky.vbs```, that handles system information, and ```Console.js```, a custom terminal library that controls the inner workings of Alpha.

# Setup

In order for Alpha to function correctly, it relies on access to ```Sparky.vbs``` and ```Kennel.js```. This latter file holds on to the paths for Sparky and the ```Kin``` directry. In it's current form, these variables must be updated to the paths of the current computer.
# commands

- ```sparky``` runs the Sparky script and outputs to the terminal
- ```whoami``` prints the curretn user
- ```help``` opens this page
- ```cls``` clears the screen
- ```theme --(light,dark)``` changes the UI theme
- ```ls``` lists files in the ```kin``` directory
